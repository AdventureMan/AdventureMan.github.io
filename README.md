This is the workings of my personal website that I use for fun.

<h3>NodeJS Usage</h3>
<p>The "Summer2016" page makes AJAX calls to a NodeJS Server running on my Raspberry Pi which then stores the submitted information in a MySQL Database also stored on the Pi</P>
<br>
<p>The NodeJS server is running with ExpressJS integration for ease of use and nifty middleware. This was my first time ever using NodeJS and ExpressJS so it is a learning experience.
Please submit any issues as "bugs." There are probably some things that aren't ideal on my Node server or files that aren't necessary, but I'll be working on optimizing and minimizing things once I solidify everything.
